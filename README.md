# DeSciHub – Decentralized Science Research Hub

## 📖 Overview
**DeSciHub** (Decentralized Science Research Hub) is a **blockchain-powered Open Science platform** that enables researchers to **publish studies, track citations via NFTs, and receive funding through tokenized grants**. This project aims to **eliminate paywalls, ensure transparent citations, and decentralize research funding**.

## ✨ Key Features
### 🔹 Immutable Research Storage
- Research papers are **stored on a decentralized network** using **IPFS and Arweave**, ensuring **permanent access** and **tamper-proof records**.

### 🔹 NFT-Based Citation Tracking
- Each paper is **minted as an NFT**, allowing **verifiable citation tracking** through **smart contract interactions**.

### 🔹 Tokenized Peer Review
- **Reviewers stake tokens** for credibility and earn **rewards** for high-quality reviews.
- Prevents biased or low-effort reviews and encourages **constructive feedback**.

### 🔹 Crowdfunded Research Grants
- Scientists **propose projects**, and the community **funds them via DAO-based governance**.
- Encourages **community-driven innovation** and **decentralized funding**.
